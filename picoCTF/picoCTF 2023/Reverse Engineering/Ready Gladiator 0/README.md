Description:

Can you make a CoreWars warrior that always loses, no ties?
Your opponent is the Imp. The source is available here. If you wanted to pit the Imp against himself, you could download the Imp and connect to the CoreWars server like this:

(run the instance and you'll have a nc session)

Hints:
1. CoreWars is a well-established game with a lot of docs and strategy
2. Experiment with input to the CoreWars handler or create a self-defeating bot
